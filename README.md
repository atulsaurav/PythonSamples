PythonSamples
=============

Python tools that come handy now and then.. 

I will maintain an index here with a brief description of each of the sample.
<ol>
<li>FileFormatter.py - This is useful while working with Informatica powercenter mappings. There are times when the inout or output files are fixed record and not delimited and there is a need to analyze the file in detail. This script converts the fixed record file to a delimitted file so it is easily importable by microsoft excel for analysis. This script extracts the structure of the file from source or target qualifier mentioned in the informatica powercenter mapping xml </li>
<li>more to come soon </li>
